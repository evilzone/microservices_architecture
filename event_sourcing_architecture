Event sourcing system

                                                                    Order service (db)

Order of events:
    - initiated
    - pending
    - completed
    - inventory update
    - mail to user
    - ask for feedback
    - archive


- state is stored as a series of events
- any record is about the state change from previous one
- we can always replay events to get the state at any point of time
    - e.g. git commit
- efficient
- asynchronous communication
- storage vs performance
    - regular snapshots
