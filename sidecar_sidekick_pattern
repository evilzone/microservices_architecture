------------------------------------------------------


Microservices

            Mobile                          Browser                     Webservices

- Account management

Advantages
    - Reduces the code duplication
    - Reduces the complexity in the main application
    - Independent from primary application in terms of run time and the language in which
        they are implemented - loose coupling
    - Can access the same resource as primary application
    - Low latency due to proximity
