Data consistency in distributed systems:
    - eventual consistency
        - eventual consistency guarantees low latency with some stale data
        - forward node has no mechanism to know about the backward failed nodes

    - strong/strict consistency
        - guarantees updated/latest data with some higher latency
        - latency will increase

- data loss due to disaster
- replicate the data across other databases
