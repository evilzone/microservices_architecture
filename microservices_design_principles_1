Microservices: design principles
--------------------------------

what are design principles?

- Independent/ Autonomous
- Resilient/ Fault tolerant/ design to failure
- Observable
- Discoverable
- Domain driven
- Decentralization
- High cohesion
- single source of truth

- Independent/ Autonomous

    Product Management          <->         Order Management        <->         Account Management
              database                              database                              database

    - small team size
    - parallel development
    - clear contracts
    - individually deployable


- Resilient/ Fault tolerant/ design to failure
    - avoid single point of failure
    - avoid cascading failure
    - consider failure as events and analyze it properly


- Observable
    - centralized monitoring
    - centralized logging
    - health check system


- Discoverable
    - All services should be registered at one place
    - It makes client's life easy when looking for specific service

- Domain driven
    - Focussed on business
    - Focussed on core domain
    - Focus on domain logic

- Decentralization
    - Database for each service
    - Choice of database depends on the nature of particular service

- High cohesion
    - Do one thing only
    - SRP
    - A business function
    - A business domain
    - Easy to take new similar feature

    - Why
        - Scalability
        - Availability

- Single source of truth
    - there should be only one source to get the complete information
    - this helps in avoiding the duplicity
